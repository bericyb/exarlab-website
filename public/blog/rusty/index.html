		<h1>Should I Learn Rust?</h1>

			<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen someone online or around you evangelizing Rust. To my observation, these voices are seeming to get louder and more prominent. You&rsquo;re beginning to wonder what all the hype is about. You&rsquo;re at the end of the diving board, but you just can seem to jump in.</p>
<p>This is the one big problem with Rust.</p>
<p>Rust is one of those things that are simultaneously alluring and off-putting.</p>
<p>Similar lifestyles or activities come to mind. Flying drones, van life, starting your own small business, or scuba diving. There are so many people that say, &ldquo;I would love to live out of a camper van and drive all across the country&rdquo; and I would argue that many programmers say the same thing about Rust. I know, because I was one of them.</p>
<h1 id="no-more-excuses">No More Excuses</h1>
<p>I always hesitated learning Rust because I used Ruby and GoLang at work. But this was really just an excuse. Besides, I didn&rsquo;t really learn any Ruby or GoLang the year that I was at that company.</p>
<p>Later, I had another excuse that I didn&rsquo;t have the time for Rust&rsquo;s rather steep learning curve. I had things to build and projects to get done. Well, those projects never got completed anyways because I was binge watching YouTube videos on why Rust is so great.</p>
<p>It can be hard to invest time into things that we genuinely think we want to do.</p>
<p>One of my great vices is YouTube. Like many others I will watch so much content about the stuff I want to do instead of actually doing it.
Living in someone else&rsquo;s dream of doing what you want to do yourself: This is the world&rsquo;s greatest trap and it&rsquo;s time to do something about it.</p>
<p>The solution is to actually learn Rust. I know you want to. Let&rsquo;s just do it.</p>
<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>Open up the terminal. Here we go.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Linux or MacOS? Run this.  Windows <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html#:~:text=x86_64%2Dunknown%2Dnetbsd-,Standalone%20installers,-The%20official%20Rust">here</a></p>
<p><code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide on something to build.</p>
<p>Hello World isn&rsquo;t gonna cut it, but we don&rsquo;t need to build Facebook. I decided on a <a href="https://github.com/bericyb/Roma">CLI Pomodoro timer</a>. Something simple that you could easily build in a language you&rsquo;re already comfortable in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build it.</p>
<p>Ask ChatGPT to teach you Rust. It&rsquo;s an amazing tutor you can ask best practice questions to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h1>
<p>Rust is challenging to learn. I believe by spelling out what exactly is difficult, we make the process a little easier and the learning curve far more bearable. Here are some things that I wish I knew better before starting.</p>
<p><img src="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/PPrustS.png" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rust is a different paradigm of memory management.</p>
<p>Javascript, Python, or GoLang have memory management abstracted away from you.</p>
<p>C and C++ have the programmer manage memory.</p>
<p>Rust has the ownership system which is enforced by the complier. This means the programmer manages the memory, but the compiler won&rsquo;t let you be a bad programmer. More info <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust&rsquo;s standard library is (really) small.</p>
<p>I was often frustrated when something simple that I wanted to do in Rust needed me to bring in a library. How am I supposed to know that so crate called &ldquo;Anyhow&rdquo; is the go-to error type. And I need some kind of runtime called &ldquo;Tokio&rdquo;? WTF?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ok. There is a reason why it is this way explained well <a href="https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/rust-stdlib/">here</a></p>
<p>Getting involved in conversations about Rust greatly helps in navigating the problem of what packages to use. <a href="https://blessed.rs/crates">Blessed.rs</a> is a great resource.</p>
<p>It can be hard to know what crates to use, when and how, but that&rsquo;s part of learning Rust. Be adventurous and explore libraries. Don&rsquo;t fear library lock-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust uses Macros pretty extensively.</p>
<p>Macros are a form of metaprogramming. A way to make code write code.</p>
<p>Macros have some unique syntax that you may not be used to. Just learn what they are and how to identify them in the wild.</p>
<p>More info <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/macros-in-rust-a-tutorial-with-examples/">here</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="good-luck">Good Luck!</h1>
<p>Deciding to learn Rust doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re gonna love it. It doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to ditch Javascript or whatever language you currently love.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing, you have nothing to lose besides some time, which you would have wasted elsewhere anyways.
Odds are, if you&rsquo;ve made it this far into this blog post, you&rsquo;ve been on the fence about learning Rust for a while now. I encourage you to jump in.</p>
<p>After all, what&rsquo;s the worst that could happen? You learn a new programming language that is safe and ultra performant.</p>
