<p>A few weeks ago, my friends and I were at a concert waiting for the main act to go on when a buddy whipped out a Thumby on his keychain.
I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it before and honestly thought it was just a cute little keychain accessory. I was absolutely floored when it actually turned on and started playing pong.</p>

<p>After the concert I immediately bought a Thumby for everyone in my family with decent eyesight.</p>
<h1 id="the-thumby-overview">the thumby overview</h1>
<p>The Thumby is actually just a RaspberryPi Pico under the hood with an OLED screen, rechargable battery, and buttons. It&rsquo;s made by TinyCircuits and at the time of writing is available <a href="https://tinycircuits.com/products/thumby">here</a> or on Amazon for about $30.
The Thumby has a whopping 2MB of storage for games and supports multiplayer through a link cable.</p>
<h1 id="open-source-goodness">open source goodness</h1>
<p>My favorite thing about the Thumby is the fact that it&rsquo;s open source! If this thing only came with the 5 games it was preloaded with, it&rsquo;d become e-waste pretty quickly. Thankfully there&rsquo;s a decently large community and a repository of Thumby games/projects with 50 contributors. Some people have made some incredible things and you can join on the fun too. I think that making a game for the Thumby is the perfect way to start contributing to open source.</p>
<h1 id="my-game">my game</h1>
<p>The game I made for the Thumby is called Astro Jumper. It&rsquo;s inspired by the classic mobile games Papi Jump, and the more widely known Doodle Jump.</p>

<p>My brother in-law is meta-ironically obsessed with Among Us, so I made the character a crewmate.
You can watch a short demo of the game <a href="https://youtu.be/mDuT7RkSMFo">here</a></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever made a 2D game with sprites before, you&rsquo;ll feel pretty comfortable making a game for the Thumby. TinyCircuits has made an incredible Web IDE for the Thumby complete with an emulator.</p>
<p>There is no real game engine for the Thumby, but there is are apis for graphics, audio, and other things. There is a MicroPython and a C/C++ Arduino library that you can use.</p>
<p>Because of a lack of a full-fat game engine things like collision detection and animations take a fair bit of work and sometimes some hacky tricks, but I think it makes the game development process that much more fun.</p>
<h1 id="gaming-minimalism">gaming minimalism</h1>
<p>I never would have thought that I would get so much enjoyment out of such a simple little thing. I almost always find myself reaching for my keys instead of my phone when I have some time to kill.
Playing games on my Thumby has always been better than opening my phone to doom scroll and leaves me in a better mood.</p>
