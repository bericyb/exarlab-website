<p>Well, no one really owns the internet, but if AWS, Google,
and many other large companies do control large portions
of it. Imagine, if <a href="https://youtu.be/ntICHMV-WMA?t=37">Google shuts down their services</a>,
would you still be able to get move on with your day?
When you think about how dependent we are on proprietary
services, it can be a little scary.</p>
<h1 id="the-walled-garden">the walled garden</h1>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that everything must be self hosted
and totally self reliant. It&rsquo;s unreasonable to spend
hours and hours designing, coding, and deploying our
own messaging services just to text our loved ones
because we fear that iMessage might have an outage
for a few hours. I think platforms and existing infrastructure
is perfectly acceptable to use. Being in the walled garden
is not necessarily a bad thing, but give some careful
consideration about what you&rsquo;re signing up for.</p>
<p>Like many things in life, there is a tradeoff. Convenience
and time vs. your freedom and control.</p>
<h1 id="worth-it">worth it</h1>
<p>My advice is to find out what parts of your digital
life you&rsquo;d like to have more control over. You may find
that currently you don&rsquo;t feel that you need any more
control over your online presence, but this may change
over time.</p>
<p>For me, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html">this story</a>
of a father&rsquo;s google account being locked down after
being wrongfully accused of child abuse was the straw
that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Almost all of my family&rsquo;s memories are stored in Google
Photos. My professional and personal communications are
almost all done through Gmail. At this point in my life,
if I were to lose access to Google services, it would be
devastating.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have the knowledge and the resources to
do something about it.</p>
<h1 id="how">how</h1>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to completely migrate from Google services
to my own services. At this point, I still feel comfortable
using them, but I would feel better with a certain level
of redundancy. There are many open source alternatives
and other service providers besides Google to choose from.
For example, <a href="https://github.com/restic/restic">Restic</a>, is an
open source backup program with support for many backends.
This is a perfectly feasible and realistic thing to do for
many tech savvy people. Some may feel that they need to
write their own cryptographically secure messaging service,
but I&rsquo;m not one of them. yet&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="i-have-nothing-to-hide">i have nothing to hide.</h1>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing anything illegal, why should I worry?&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s
wonderful to hear, but unfortunately it isn&rsquo;t enough.
People like the father I previously mentioned DO get caught
in the crossfire. I have nothing to hide either, but I can mitigate
the risk of losing all the data I have tied to Google in case
something were to go wrong if I control my own online presence.
You never know how the data that is gathered on your will be
used or misconstrued, so a good place to start is &ldquo;not keeping
all your eggs in one basket&rdquo;.</p>
