			<h1 id="conception">conception</h1>
<p>I have a ritual of getting a new keyboard every time I start a new job.
I&rsquo;m not sure why I do it, but it&rsquo;s a good way to get myself excited
about the code that I will get to write and the work I will do.
Most recently, I decided to build my own keyboard by hand and on
the cheap. I&rsquo;m talking 3D printed case, cheap switches, and generic
keycaps. The only thing I splurged on was the microcontroller. (more
on that later).</p>
<p>Because I decided to make my keyboard by hand however, I was eager to
make something unique and special. After all, custom keyboards can
be as much about self-expression as they are productivity. Inspired
by the look and the practicality of the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck">Ergodox Planck EZ</a>
I decided to build a 40% ortholinear keyboard, but at literally less
than half the price.</p>
<h1 id="the-case">the case</h1>
<p>The case was by far the hardest part of the build. I decided to go
with the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4207020">Void40</a>. 3D
printing this guy was a real pain in the @$$. This 3D print is
specifically made to fit on the bed of an Ender 3 (the same printer
I have) when printed diagonally. While the 3D model&rsquo;s dimensions are
just the right size to fit on the physical print bed, the stock
Ender 3 firmware restrictions do not let you use the full print bed
area. Instead, there is a safety of 15mm in both the x and y direction.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a image showing just how close the stock Ender 3 is to being
able to print this keyboard case.</p>

<p>After half a dozen failed prints I discovered that I needed
to install custom firmware on my 3D printer to get access to
the full size bed in software. Using <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/ender-3-bed-size-what-is-it-really/">this</a>
guide, I was finally able to successfully print a full case.</p>

<h1 id="the-switches-and-keys">the switches and keys</h1>
<p>I was on a budget so Gateron mx style switches were a natural choice.
I went with brown since I like the tactile feel, but wanted
to maintain relationships with the people I work with in-office.
Clicky switches are for kids is my hot take. For keys, I
just went with generic blank XDA keycaps. The best prices that
I could find were on <a href="https://flashquark.com/">flashquark</a>.</p>
<h1 id="microcontroller-and-misc-parts">microcontroller and misc parts</h1>
<p>I have had bad experience with bluetooth keyboards in the
past due to their long delays when starting to type, or with the
latency in the connection. Because of this I was fine with a
wired keyboard as long as it was USB type C. At this point,
nothing in my life except my Ti-84 calculator used micro USB.
Naturally, I chose the Elite C micro controller.</p>
<p>Other miscellaneous parts included plenty of diodes, heat
shrink tubing, wiring, and hardware to close the case up with
its components.</p>
<h1 id="assembly">assembly</h1>
<p>Putting together the components is simple, but just time
consuming. Because, I didn&rsquo;t use a PCB, connecting all the
switches requires soldering a diode and a wire to each row
and column of the switches. Because my keys were laid out
linearly, it wasn&rsquo;t hard to figure out where to solder what.
Here&rsquo;s what the internal wiring looks like</p>
<p><img src="/images/keyboard/wired.jpg" alt="">
<img src="/images/keyboard/fullwired.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you look closely, you can see each row and column&rsquo;s
wiring go to a connection on the microcontroller. When a key
is pressed, the connection is closed on a row and column.
This allows the microcontroller to determine which key was
pressed by checking which row and column&rsquo;s circuit was closed.
Effectively an X and Y coordinate for each key on the board.</p>
<h1 id="programming">programming</h1>
<p>QMK is a opensource firmware for microcontrollers that are
commonly used in keyboards. It allows for people to make their
own keymappings for their custom builds as well as manufactured
boards. I used QMK to program my microcontroller. The maker of
the VOID40 keyboard case has their own fork of QMK that
provides a great starting point for keymapping.</p>
<p>I wanted to make my keyboard as efficient as possible for
programming by placing commonly used special symbols as close as
possible to the home row.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my layout with the 3 different layers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely thrilled about how this board turned out.
I was worried about a cheap feel, but the 3D printed case
holds up great. The ortholinear layout seemed daunting at first,
but I believe that anyone with decent touch typing skills
would easily be able to start using the keyboard at decent
speed.</p>
