summary: "why we should own the internet, and how?"

# who owns the internet?

Well, no one really owns the internet, but if AWS, Google, 
and many other large companies do control large portions
of it. Imagine, if [Google shuts down their services](https://youtu.be/ntICHMV-WMA?t=37),
would you still be able to get move on with your day?
When you think about how dependent we are on proprietary 
services, it can be a little scary. 

# the walled garden

Now, I'm not saying that everything must be self hosted
and totally self reliant. It's unreasonable to spend 
hours and hours designing, coding, and deploying our 
own messaging services just to text our loved ones
because we fear that iMessage might have an outage 
for a few hours. I think platforms and existing infrastructure
is perfectly acceptable to use. Being in the walled garden 
is not necessarily a bad thing, but give some careful 
consideration about what you're signing up for. 

Like many things in life, there is a tradeoff. Convenience
and time vs. your freedom and control. 

# worth it

My advice is to find out what parts of your digital 
life you'd like to have more control over. You may find 
that currently you don't feel that you need any more
control over your online presence, but this may change
over time. 

For me, [this story](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html)
of a father's google account being locked down after 
being wrongfully accused of child abuse was the straw
that broke the camel's back. 

Almost all of my family's memories are stored in Google
Photos. My professional and personal communications are
almost all done through Gmail. At this point in my life,
if I were to lose access to Google services, it would be
devastating. 

Thankfully, I have the knowledge and the resources to 
do something about it. 

# how

I don't need to completely migrate from Google services
to my own services. At this point, I still feel comfortable 
using them, but I would feel better with a certain level
of redundancy. There are many open source alternatives 
and other service providers besides Google to choose from. 
For example, [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic), is an 
open source backup program with support for many backends.
This is a perfectly feasible and realistic thing to do for
many tech savvy people. Some may feel that they need to 
write their own cryptographically secure messaging service,
but I'm not one of them. yet...

# i have nothing to hide.

"I'm not doing anything illegal, why should I worry?". That's 
wonderful to hear, but unfortunately it isn't enough. 
People like the father I previously mentioned DO get caught 
in the crossfire. I have nothing to hide either, but I can mitigate 
the risk of losing all the data I have tied to Google in case
something were to go wrong if I control my own online presence.
You never know how the data that is gathered on your will be 
used or misconstrued, so a good place to start is "not keeping
all your eggs in one basket".
