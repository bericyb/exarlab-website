# what is homelabbing?

Homelabbing is being a sysadmin as a hobby.

And it's one of those hobbies that looks kinda weird from the outside, 
but just like minimalism, command-line tools
and driving a manual transmission car, homelabbing can seem inconvenient
on the surface, 
but can provide great satisfaction and opportunities to learn many amazing things. 

Some people will have a network-attached storage device (NAS) for 
storing family photos and movies, etc. 
Some will host their own Minecraft server, or website. 
Those are all home labs. 

In fact, this blog is a website that I'm hosting completely on my own server and 
eventually, I'll have more than just this website. I hope to have some other services 
available to both me and the public. 

# hardware

Software is nothing without something to run it on. My weapon of choice is the old laptop I used in high-school. It's a total piece, but that's the thing about servers, they don't need to be powerful at all if you're just a budding homelabber. A spinning hard drive, 6GB of RAM, and a mobile processor work just fine for what I'm looking to do. 

# os

The OS my server is running is the Arch distro of Linux BTW. It's what is most comfortable for me, and at this point I don't need a desktop environment or GUI for my server. 

# services and future plans

Right now my homelab isn't much with just nginx serving up this static website, but I have some bigger things in store. Some of the next things I'd like to tackle is self hosting my own search engine, git version control, and data backups. 


# your turn

Already, I've learned a lot just setting up my own homelab. It feels good to be taking
the internet back and learning more as I do it. 
See why you should homelab [here](/blog/chown/). Not everything has to be hosted on AWS, and it can often be more rewarding not too.

Already I can feel the satisfaction of owning and controlling all parts of my lab. The 
cloud of misconception I had about the internet is fading away as I realize how the internet works on a deeper more personal level.

Much like learning to use the command-line, homelabbing was a little clunky at first, 
but now I feel confident in my abilities. Even further, I feel like it is the superior way to a certain number of things. Here's to learning more in the future by 
pushing outside of my comfort zone.

Thanks for visiting my homelab. Feel free to take a look at the other content that I've written.
