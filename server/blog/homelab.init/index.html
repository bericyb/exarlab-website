			<h1 id="what-is-homelabbing">what is homelabbing?</h1>
<p>Homelabbing is being a sysadmin as a hobby.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of those hobbies that looks kinda weird from the outside,
but just like minimalism, command-line tools
and driving a manual transmission car, homelabbing can seem inconvienent
on the surface,
but can provide great satifaction and opportunities to learn many amazing things.</p>
<p>Some people will have a network-attached storage device (NAS) for
storing family photos and movies, etc.
Some will host their own Minecraft server, or website.
Those are all home labs.</p>
<p>In fact, this blog is a website that I&rsquo;m hosting completely on my own server and
eventually, I&rsquo;ll have more than just this website. I hope to have some other services
available to both me and the public.</p>
<h1 id="hardware">hardware</h1>
<p>Software is nothing without something to run it on. My weapon of choice is the old laptop I used in high-school. It&rsquo;s a total piece, but that&rsquo;s the thing about servers, they don&rsquo;t need to be powerful at all if you&rsquo;re just a budding homelabber. A spinning hard drive, 6GB of RAM, and a mobile processor work just fine for what I&rsquo;m looking to do.</p>
<h1 id="os">os</h1>
<p>The OS my server is running is the Arch distro of Linux BTW. It&rsquo;s what is most comfortable for me, and at this point I don&rsquo;t need a desktop environment or GUI for my server.</p>
<h1 id="services-and-future-plans">services and future plans</h1>
<p>Right now my homelab isn&rsquo;t much with just nginx serving up this static website, but I have some bigger things in store. Some of the next things I&rsquo;d like to tackle is self hosting my own search engine, git version control, and data backups.</p>
<h1 id="your-turn">your turn</h1>
<p>Already, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot just setting up my own homelab. It feels good to be taking
the internet back and learning more as I do it.
See why you should homelab <a href="/blog/chown/">here</a>. Not everything has to be hosted on AWS, and it can often be more rewarding not too.</p>
<p>Already I can feel the satisfaction of owning and controlling all parts of my lab. The
cloud of misconception I had about the internet is fading away as I realize how the internet works on a deeper more personal level.</p>
<p>Much like learning to use the command-line, homelabbing was a little clunky at first,
but now I feel confident in my abilities. Even further, I feel like it is the superior way to a certain number of things. Here&rsquo;s to learning more in the future by
pushing outside of my comfort zone.</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting my homelab. Feel free to take a look at the other content that I&rsquo;ve written.</p>
