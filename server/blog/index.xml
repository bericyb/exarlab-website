      <description>fun++ The majority of the fun in homelabbing is making your network and systems exactly the way you want them to be. For the longest time I avoided setting up a homelab just because I thought it was work, but it ended up being more fun than work in the end.
Let me run you through what I set up for myself. Most of the things I talk about here are super basic or only specific only to me, but you may find some things that would apply to your own homelab.</description>

      <description>what is homelabbing? Homelabbing is being a sysadmin as a hobby.
And it&amp;rsquo;s one of those hobbies that looks kinda weird from the outside, but just like minimalism, command-line tools and driving a manual transmission car, homelabbing can seem inconvienent on the surface, but can provide great satifaction and opportunities to learn many amazing things.
Some people will have a network-attached storage device (NAS) for storing family photos and movies, etc.</description>
