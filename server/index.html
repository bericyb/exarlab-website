		fun++ The majority of the fun in homelabbing is making your network and systems exactly the way you want them to be. For the longest time I avoided setting up a homelab just because I thought it was work, but it ended up being more fun than work in the end.
Let me run you through what I set up for myself. Most of the things I talk about here are super basic or only specific only to me, but you may find some things that would apply to your own homelab.

		what is homelabbing? Homelabbing is being a sysadmin as a hobby.
And it&rsquo;s one of those hobbies that looks kinda weird from the outside, but just like minimalism, command-line tools and driving a manual transmission car, homelabbing can seem inconvienent on the surface, but can provide great satifaction and opportunities to learn many amazing things.
Some people will have a network-attached storage device (NAS) for storing family photos and movies, etc.
